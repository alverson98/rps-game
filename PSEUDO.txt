Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

NEED:
- alerts
- prompts
- confirms
- variables

logic of this game -  user will select a value and the computer will select randomly value

how does a user win this game?

R beats Scissors
P beats Rock
S beats Paper


what dtat do I need to track in the app?
wins, losses, ties --> create variables

computer selection - how a, I going to have the pc randomly choose one of these 3 values??

R,P,S ?

// array has index     0    1    2
var computerChoice = ["R", "P", "S"]

Math.floor()
Math.random()

Once we have the user selection and random computer selection...
need to compare the two values to see if the user won, loss, or tied
        - use if statement

if user wins - wins++

logical operators...
&& both need to be true
|| one needs to be true

Can I use a function?
